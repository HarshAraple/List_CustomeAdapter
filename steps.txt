create project in android studio.
design your layout in layout.xml file.
create a Student(your class name) class and take some variable and create constructor and also create their properties.
Now you need to create another list_view_layout(layout file) to display data in list.
In second layout you just display your output.
Now we create a custome adapter class(ListAdapter.java).
In, ListAdapter.java file you need to take instance of Content and List<Student> and create constructor.
And implement all methods.
So,their four methods 
(1.) getCount()  (2.) getItem(int position)  (3.) getItemId(int position)  (4.) getView(int position,View convertView,ViewGroup parent)
Now,you need to go MainActivity.java file declare variables.
And In Buttton onClickListner you just add value in adapter.
Run Project.
